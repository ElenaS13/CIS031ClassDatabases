Review
Congratulations! We’ve learned six commands commonly used to manage data stored in a relational database and how to set constraints on such data. What can we generalize so far?

SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.

> * A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
> * A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
> * A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

* CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
* INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
* SELECT queries data from a table.
* ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
* UPDATE edits a row in a table.
* DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.
* Constraints add information about how a column can be used.
